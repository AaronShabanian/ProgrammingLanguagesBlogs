<h2>Haskell Operators</h2>
Haskell has basic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Range. In this blog I will go over each of these operators, their syntax and how
to implement/use them. 

<br>
<h3> Addition </h3> 
As in most programming languages like python and java the symbol for addition is `+`. 
To implement something like this in haskell we could do something as seen below. 
<br>
<code> 
   let a = 2 
   let b = 2 
   putStrLn "answer="
   print(a+b)
  </code>
  <br>
As can be seen, this is very similar to python and other programming languages like Java and C++. When this is run, we should see an output of <br>
<code> answer=2
  </code> <br>
 <h3> Subtraction </h3> 
Subtraction would be very similar to this, following the same set of steps. This makes it again very similar to python and other imperative programming langauages. <br>
<code> 
   let a = 2 
   let b = 2 
   putStrLn "answer=" 
   print(a-b)
  </code> <br>
The output of this is pretty obvious to tell and would be <code> answer=0 </code>
<br>

<h3> Multiplication </h3
As in most programming languages like python and java the symbol for multiplication is `*`. The following example shows what multiplication would look like in Haskell. 
   <br> 
   <code> 
   let a = 2 
   let b = 2 
   putStrLn "answer="
   print(a*b)
  </code>
  <br>
   The output of this program would be as expected and would be <code> ans=4 </code>
   <br>
 <h3> Division </h3>
 The Symbol for division is `/`. The following example shows what division would look like
 <br> 
   <code> 
   let a = 2 
   let b = 2 
   putStrLn "answer="
   print(a*b)
  </code>
  <br>
   The output of this program would be as expected and would be <code> ans=1 </code>
   
  <h3> Range </h3>
  Range is a very interesting operator that can not really be found in other programing languages like java and python. Range returns a list of numbers or letters between a 
  start and an end. The symbol for range is `..`. One example of this operator can be seen below. 
  <br>
  
  <code> 
   print[1..10]
   <\code>
      
  <br>
  The result of this function would be <code> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] </code>
  <br>
  This function can be useful when you want to create a list that is very long. This can help save a lot of time and efficiency to the developer writing a program
  
 <br>
 Overall addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are very similar to how they would be implemented in other programing languages and serve the same use. Range however is a little different as I have not seen it before haskell. I think this could serve many uses and help the development process.
