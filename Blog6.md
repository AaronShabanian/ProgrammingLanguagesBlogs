<h2>Haskell Operators</h2>
Haskell has basic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Range. In this blog I will go over each of these operators, their syntax and how
to implement/use them.

<h3> Addition </h3> 
As in most programming languages like python and java the symbol for addition is `+`. 
To implement something like this in haskell we could do something as seen below. 
<code> 
   let a = 2 
   let b = 2 
   putStrLn "answer="
   print(a+b)
  </code>
As can be seen, this is very similar to python and other programming languages like Java and C++. When this is run, we should see an output of 
<code> answer=2
  </code>
 <h3> Subtraction </h3> 
Subtraction would be very similar to this, following the same set of steps. This makes it again very similar to python and other imperative programming langauages. 
<code> 
   let a = 2 
   let b = 2 
   putStrLn "answer= 
   print(a-b)
  </code>
The output of this is pretty obvious to tell and would be <code> answer=0 </code>
